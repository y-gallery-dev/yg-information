# Y!g Information
Information and timeline of various events for Y!g

Hi all. We figured we'd make a public document that has a record of every edit available to you all on our developer repo. This way you can all see exactly what changes we make to this document. We'll be adding dates to each of the following items as we complete them.
We've enabled the `Sponsor` feature on this repo for if you want to support us financially. @brocococonut is currently shouldering the all alpha and beta related costs, including this github org, server costs, etc - so if you can help him out, that'd be greatly appreciated.
